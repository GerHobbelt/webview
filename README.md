# webview

This project is a lightweight fork of the awesome [webview project](https://github.com/zserge/webview).

## Why does this fork exist?

There are a number of changes that are needed for the Wails framework that wouldn't fit in with the goals of the upstream project. Updates that would benefit the upstream project will be contributed wherever possible. This fork is not suitable for projects outside of Wails, so if you need a webview library, please check out the [original project](https://github.com/zserge/webview).
